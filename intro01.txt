Your alarm goes off while you're in the shower. You stumble out onto the bathmat in an early-morning stupor, flailing for a towel to wrap around yourself. It's an awkward hop, skip and jump 
back to your bedroom as you try to weigh speed and the desire to not track water down the hallway.

It's all for nothing in the end. You bump into your very grumpy looking dad on his way out of your room, and only belatedly process the fact that you can't hear your alarm anymore.

He somehow manages to give you an intimidating staredown through sleepy, half-closed eyes. "It's five in the morning," he growls.

"Sorry," you say. "Forgot to turn off my alarm when I got up."

Your dad shakes his head. "Just keep it down," he says, shuffling past you.

You nod, letting him move past you and slipping into the privacy of your bedroom.

You hope your dad isn't going to make a [i]thing[/i] of this. Truth is, you've been getting up this early for months now.

        Your mechanics have always been solid, and you've never struggled to hold your own in high elo games. Lately though, you've been putting in the effort to get up early and 
        grind solo queue, and it's starting to pay off. Anyone can win a fight when their team's ahead in gold, or they have a favourable hero matchup, but recently you've noticed that you're 
        starting to be able to clutch out situations you're 'expected' to lose with raw mechanical skill. 

        You've even been lucky enough to pull off some of your flashiest outplays in games with popular streamers, and had a few clips go viral in the community.

        Sometimes it seems a little crazy even to you, that some of your best friends are people you've never even met, living on the other side of the planet. You met through Pelican, who started 
        playing on the US servers while visiting family here during the holidays. The two of you hit it off during a solo queue game, and started duoing. When he went back to Korea, he introduced 
        you to the rest of his friend group, and you've been playing together ever since. The ping is pretty rough for you, playing on Korean servers, but the quality of the games tends to be better 
        than in the US, and getting to play high-level games with a consistent team has taught you a lot.
        
        Your friends are all great at the game, of course, but one of them — Neph — is truly incredible. The rest of you are pretty convinced they'll get pro offers as soon as they turn eighteen. If 
        things go as you hope this season, maybe you'll be right there with them one day.
    #You use the time before school to VOD review last night's games.

        Quantity of practice is less important than [i]usefulness[/i] of practice — a lot of players don't get that. Rather than spend your extra time grinding out more solo queue, you analyze 
        your recent games, looking for areas where you can improve both your micro and your macro game. It's definitely helped you improve your mechanics, but you've really noticed the improvement 
        in your game sense as a whole.
        
        Getting better at the game is its own reward, of course, but being disciplined about VOD review is also an excellent habit to get into if you want to go pro.

        Sleep is the first thing to get cut when there aren't enough hours in the day, and you just don't have the time to go to school, grind Ladder, do your homework [i]and[/i] get a full 
        eight hours. A lot of players in your shoes — maybe most, even — would just let their grades slip, but you've carved out this time in the morning to stay on top of your schoolwork. It's not 
        glamorous, but if nothing else it keeps your parents off your back.
    #You just enjoy it. There's nothing worse than wasting hours in the day.

        You've come to realise lately that you actually just enjoy being an early riser, getting a start on the day while most of the world is still asleep. You haven't committed yourself to any one 
        thing in the mornings, and split your time fairly evenly between Ladder, schoolwork and other obligations. You know better than most people your age how little advantages stack up, and a lifetime's 
        worth of early mornings will add up to a significant edge over your peers.

This early morning routine is ingrained into your bones by this point: hang your towel up to dry, throw some clothes on, power on your computer and pad down the hall for breakfast while you wait for it 
to boot.
