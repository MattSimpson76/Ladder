Personality stats will never affect which choices you can select, but can determine how you act and are described within scenes. They can also
result in relationship bonuses or penalties with other characters during the story's various timeskips (as your character
is assumed to be acting in accordance with their personality stats while "off-screen").

Your personality stats are constantly changing as you make choices.

Skill stats unlock new choices, and determine how well some always available choices go for your character. 

Each skill stat increases as you make choices that rely on that skill.
